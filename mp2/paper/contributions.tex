\subsection*{General}
Xinyue: Wrote report for 1.1.

Tifany: Wrote report for 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2.

\subsection*{Extra credit}
Mingyo Seo: Constructed Graphical User Interface. Constructed a structure for larger game boards. (2)
           Came up with the idea of reordering child nodes in alpha-beta pruning
Xinyue Xu: Designed and implemented the flip coin rule.\\
           Implemented the improved alpha-beta pruning with child nodes sorting.
Tifany: Constructed a larger game board (7x7).
\subsection*{Part 1}
Xinyue: Implemented part 1.1.

Mingyo: Built and helped implement an algorithm for CSP such that avoids segments' intersection. (Problem 1.2)

Tifany: Helped implement the graph-generation algorithm that avoids intersections. Implemented map coloring with and without forward checking and heuristics. Implemented local search.
\subsection*{Part 2}
Mingyo: Built functions for rules. (simple, battle, duel. attrition) Designed Evaluation Function for MinMax Problem. (Problem 2.2)
