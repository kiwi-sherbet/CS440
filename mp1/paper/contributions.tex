\subsubsection*{1.1}
Mingyo:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Traced the code and checked logic for the DFS, BFS, greedy best-first search, and A* algorithms.

Tifany:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Implemented DFS, BFS, greedy best-first search, and A* algorithms.
  \item Documented algorithm solutions in the report and described algorithm implementation and data structures choices in the report, including how to get good performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{1.2}
Mingyo:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Developed the alternate heuristic, where the heuristic is the Manhattan distance multiplied by the forward movement cost plus the turn cost.

Tifany:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Implemented the modified A* algorithms, using either Manhattan distance or alternate heuristic, that takes into account forward movement and turn costs, along with the alternate heuristic.
  \item Helped debug and design the fix for the above bug and implemented it.
  \item Documented alternate heuristic, its admissibility, and why it is more informed.
\end{itemize}

  \item Suggested an idea of restricting the number of goals to examine to expand less nodes.
\end{itemize}
Tifany:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
